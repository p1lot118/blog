# Music Source Seperation (MSS) Theory
<br>

While learning how to mix and master different instruments and making into a complete piece, I have always wondered how each sounds can be seperated.

## How do sound waves becomes a song?

First, we need to know how the sound waves harmonate with each other to make a song.

As different instruments have different frequencies and density, some parts get overlapped with each other.

## How to seperate noise?

Time-frequency representation

- audio signals are first converted into a **spectrogram**  using **Short-Time Fourier Transform**

### How to read spectrogram?

- X axis (left to right) shows **time**
- Y axis (bottom to top) shows **pitch/frequency**
- colour / brightness shows **loudness**

> This is vocal

This vocal line has vibrato, represented by the waves whereas piano has no vibrato.
