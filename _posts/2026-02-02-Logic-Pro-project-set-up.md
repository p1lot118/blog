**Use musical grid**: display bars / beats rather than seconds.

**Use flex time**: automatically stretch or compress audio to match the project's tempo.

**Tempo**: the Speed of your song in beats per minute (BPM).

**Key signiture**: default key for the project.

**Time Signature**: how many beats are in a bar.

**sample rate**: setting up resolution of the audio, 44.1 kHz for spotify and CD but 48 is fine.

**Frame rate**: (only for video) music's timecode to the video's frame.
