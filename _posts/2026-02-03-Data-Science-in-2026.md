# Expectation of Data Science in 2026

<br>

We are currently living in a very rapid and fast changing world, especially with data science field intertwined with LLMs.
New advanced models are coming out every week, new software tools are released to simplify all the time consuming jobs such as creating a dashboard.

Within platforms like social media, podcasts and news articles, there are definitely exaggerations and so called 'noise' that projects current market to be horrible and concerning.
This includes leading people to unemployment (although its partiall true), confusion and falling behind from the fast evoloving technology.

However there is no need to have our fear or worries involved when viewing the current market.

In this post, i would like to present my idea of **how i will survive 2026 as a data engineer** in reference to César Soto Valero's opinion based video.

## Impact over Artifact, Strategist over Reporter.

As more tools and models are released more frequetly, data scientist and analysts are no longer just delivering insights or suggestions. 

**But instead, holding accountable for outcome.**

For Data analystics, creating a pretty dashboard is **no longer impressive**. There are AI tools that only requires data set to produce good quality dashboards in seconds.

Now it is time to pivot from just being regular reporters to strategists where you answer "what happens if this continues?" or "what should we try next?". This is **tangible and real outcome** that directly impacts the company's revenue.

For Applied Machine Learning, training a model is no longer something that stands out from the resume. 

In the current market, its only the major companies that advancing and releasing new model of the AI with their astronomical assets.
Trying to develop your own shows your development skills but when it comes to delivering an actual a model that will be used for business, its falls from the competition with giant tech companies' models.

This has now shifted the expectation to be '**running the production - stand behind it - if it acts up - then fix and maintain it**'.


## From building a model to running a system.

As the expectation of data related role is leaning towards a blend of statistics, engineering and business judgement, instead of training model, **managing decision making system** would be the key role.

<br>

This involves dealing with:

- data pipelines
- changing assumptions
- "nondeterministic LLMs"
- latency
- security

<br>

So the problem itself won't be model itself but rather the pipeline, the metrics and user expectations.


## Summary

To summarise the main points:

**1. Optimize for Ownership.**

  > Do not chase every new tool. Instead, focus on your ability to own a project end-to-end, as ownership is the "best teacher".
   
**2. Get Comfortable with Failure.**

  > Expect data to drift and metrics to fall. The people who grow fastest are those who analyze failure without ego, asking "What did I miss?" rather than being defensive.

**3. Learn "Just Enough" Engineering.**
   
  > You don't need to be a backend expert, but you must understand pipelines, deployment, and monitoring. This is a "massive edge" that turns you into someone who "makes things happen".

**4. Speak the Language of Business.**

  > Move beyond accuracy metrics. Explain your work in terms of revenue, cost, risk, retention, and experience to be seen as a business partner rather than technical support.


**5. Chase Leverage, Not Titles.**

  > A senior title without ownership is just a "shiny sticker." Real career growth comes from work that shapes decisions for many users
